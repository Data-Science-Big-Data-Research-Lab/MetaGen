Performance tracking

Solver users, when running a metaheuristic, can optionally visualize key parameter evolution, such as the best fitness progression, the average fitness trend, and the number of individuals evaluated at each iteration. This visualization is done through TensorBoard, requiring the installation of the tensorboard package. This feature is a valuable tool for understanding the optimization process in real time and comparing the effectiveness of different metaheuristics for model optimization.
